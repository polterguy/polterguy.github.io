# About Magic, AINIRO and Hyperlambda

Magic Cloud and Hyperlambda is developed and maintained by Thomas Hansen, focusing on cloud, software development automation, artificial intelligence, and Low-Code frameworks. The entire codebase is open source, and you can use Magic and Hyperlambda in your own proprietary (closed source) projects as long as you contribute back any improvements to the core itself. Due to its modularised architecture, you would probably want to follow [this recipe](/documentation/magic.clone/)
if you want to clone Magic.

## About Magic Cloud

Magic was originally created by Thomas Hansen our CEO as a _"hobby project"_, to solve
the repetetive tasks he experienced himself as an enterprise software developer within the
FinTech space, but at some point Magic became such a solid product that we decided to start a company
around it and look for funding. Hyperlambda is currently documented at [Microsoft's website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2017/june/csharp-make-csharp-more-dynamic-with-hyperlambda), it has 1.5 million page views
at [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/3044876/mrgaia.html), and it's got roughly 4 million downloads of its NuGet packages.
