# Endpoints

Magic contains a whole range of endpoints, or _"middleware"_ parts, that the system itself
relies upon to function. You can play around with these endpoints by using the _"Endpoints"_
menu item in your dashboard and ensure you show your system endpoints.
Most of these endpoints are for internal use through the Magic dashboard, and should as a general
rule of thumb _not_ be consumed directly by you - But some of these endpoints are useful for things such
as implementing authentication and authorisation in your own code.

![Endpoints](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polterguy/polterguy.github.io/master/images/endpoints.jpg)

Notice, all endpoints that requires authorization of some sort assumes a valid JWT token is transmitted
in the `Authorization` HTTP header as a _"Bearer"_ type of token, and if not, the user will not be
allowed to invoke the endpoint, and an HTTP status code of 401 will be returned. To retrieve a JWT token
use the `magic/system/auth/authenticate` endpoint.

## Authentication and authorisation endpoints

These are the endpoints related to the authentication and authorisation parts of Magic. You can find
their Hyperlambda files in the _"/system/auth/"_ folder. These endpoints are typically useful for you
as you implement your own authentication logic in your own code, and most of these endpoints
are intended for you to consume yourself as you see fit.

### GET magic/system/auth/authenticate

This endpoint allows you to authenticate towards your Magic backend with a username and password
combination. It's mostly a thin layer on top of your **[magic.auth.authenticate]** slot.
**[magic.auth.authenticate]** requires two query arguments being as follows.

* __[username]__ - Username of user wanting to authenticate
* __[password]__ - Password of user wanting to authenticate

The endpoint can be invoked by anyone, and does not have any authorisation requirements. The endpoint
will return a JWT token you can use for consecutive requests towards your backend, authorising you
to invoke endpoints your user is authorised to invoking. Notice, Magic relies upon the JWT tokens
being transmitted as _"Bearer"_ tokens in the _"Authorization"_ HTTP header, implying you'll have to
ensure the resulting JWT token from invoking the above endpoint is attached to your HTTP requests as
such in later requests. This endpoint can be invoked by anyone, including non-authenticated clients.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### PUT magic/system/auth/change-password

This endpoint allows an existing user to change his or her password. It can only change the password of
the currently authenticated user, and takes the new password as the following payload. This endpoint
can be invoked by anyone as long as you have authenticated towards your backend previously. This endpoint
can also be invoked with a _"change password"_ type of JWT token, generated by the backend if the caller
forgot his or her password, and requested to change his or her password somehow.

```
{
  "password": "new-password"
}
```

This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### GET magic/system/auth/endpoints

This endpoint returns the authorisation requirements for all endpoints in the system. It does not require
any arguments. It returns one item for each Hyperlambda endpoint in the system, with its associated verb,
and a list of roles the user must belong to in order to invoke the endpoint, if the endpoint requires
authorisation. The endpoint can be invoked by anyone, and does not have any authorisation requirements
itself. Notice, this endpoint caches its result for 5 minutes, implying changes done to the authorisation
requirements of your endpoints will not be accessible for clients before 5 minutes after your changes have
been applied, unless you explicitly delete the cache item for the endpoint.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### GET magic/system/auth/impersonate

This endpoint allows you to generate a JWT token on behalf of another user, by providing a username allowing
you to impersonate the other user in the system. The endpoint requires the following argument(s).

* __[username]__ - Username of user to impersonate

This endpoint can only be invoked by a root user. This endpoint is useful when debugging user related
errors, and/or supporting/helping users who for some reasons needs help, allowing you to use the
system within the context of the user you impersonate.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/auth/reset-password

This endpoint allows you to generate a reset password JWT token on behalf of another user, by providing a
username, returning a _"reset password"_ JWT token that can _only_ be used to reset the user's password.
The endpoint requires the following argument(s).

* __[username]__ - Username of user to generate token for

This endpoint can only be invoked by a root user. However there exists another endpoint you can see further
down in this document allowing a user to have Magic send him a _"forgot password email"_.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### PUT magic/system/auth/imprison

This endpoint allows you to _"imprison"_ a user in your system. When a user is imprisoned, the user cannot
login to the system for as long as the user is _"imprisoned"_. This endpoint can only be invoked by a root user,
and the endpoint relies upon scheduled tasks to release users imprisoned, so the endpoint will not function
correctly unless scheduled tasks are enabled in the system. The endpoint takes the following JSON payload.

```
{
  "username": "user-to-imprison",
  "releaseDate": "2022-01-31T05:44:52.439Z"
}
```

The release date is the date when the user should be released from his _"imprisonment"_. This endpoint
is considered obsolete and might be removed in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/auth/refresh-ticket

This endpoint allows an already authenticated user to retrieve a new JWT token with an expiration date
further into the future. The idea of the endpoint is to allow for an authenticated user to non-stop
constantly invoke this endpoint some few minutes before his existing JWT token expires, to retrieve
a new JWT token, preventing the user from being thrown out of the backend as his or her existing token
expires. The endpoint does not take any arguments, but can only be invoked by an already authenticated
user, implying you'll need to pass in your JWT token to it in the Authorization HTTP header as a
_"Bearer"_ token or the endpoint will return _"Access denied"_.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### POST magic/system/auth/register

This endpoint allows a user to register in your backend, which implies creating a new user. The endpoint
requires the username to be a valid email address. If you want users to confirm their email address as they
register, you'll have to configure your SMTP settings. Configuring your SMTP settings can be done by reading
the [following parts](/documentation/magic.lambda.mail/). In addition you need to provide a `frontendUrl`
to the endpoint that will be used by the email template as a _"confirm email address link"_
is sent to the user to dynamically create a link the user must click to confirm his or her email address. The
endpoint requires the payload below to be transmitted by the client. Notice, the `frontendUrl`
is only used if the system has been configured with an SMTP server, resulting in that the endpoint
invocation tries to send the registered user an email to have the user confirm his or her email address.
If you don't care about having users confirm their email address, and/or haven't configured SMTP
settings, you don't have to supply the `frontendUrl` argument.

When a user registers using this endpoint, a new user will be created, but the user will be added to
the _"unconfirmed"_ role, resulting in that the user have no access to any parts of the system at
all before his or her email address has been confirmed. When his or her email address is confirmed,
the _"unconfirmed"_ user/role association is deleted, and the user is added to the _"guest"_ role. The guest
role still doesn't have access to much of the system, so if the user is to gain access to more of the
system, this must be manually added by a root user after the user has confirmed his or her email address.

```
{
  "username": "john@doe.com",
  "password": "some-password",
  "frontendUrl": "https://your-frontend-url.com",
  "template": "/some/path/to-some-email-template.html",
  "subject": "Subject line of registration email",
  "extra": {
    "name": "John Doe"
  }
}
```

The above arguments implies the following.

* __[username]__ - Username for user, implying user's email address
* __[password]__ - Password user wants to use on site
* __[frontendUrl]__ - The URL to the frontend responsible for validating the user's email address. Optional, and if not given will not send user a _"confirm email address"_ email
* __[template]__ - The full relative path to an email template used to send user a verify email address link. Optional, and if not given will default to _"/system/auth/email-templates/register.html"_
* __[subject]__ - Subject line of welcome email. Optional, and if not supplied the default value of _"Thank you for registering with Aista Magic Cloud"_ will be used
* __[extra]__ - Additional key/value list of extra information associated with the user. See remarks below for details.

The **[extra]** field is _optional_ and if not supplied will be ignored. This field declares additional extra
information associated with the created user, and can be anything you wish, such as for instance _"phone"_,
_"name"_, etc. Notice, what type of extra information the system accepts is configured as a comma separated
list in your _"appsettings.json"_ file, and can be edited in the _"Config"_ menu item, by adding a key named
_"extra"_ beneath your _"registration"_ configuration object. By default the only accepted extra information
you can associate with users is _"name"_, but if you for instance want to allow users to provide their phone
number as they are registering in addition to their names, you can modify this section as follows.

```
{
  "magic": {
    "auth": {
      "registration": {
        "extra": "name,phone"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Whatever extra information you pass in to this endpoint during registration, will be associated with the user
and returned as the user authenticates.
This endpoint does not require the caller to be authenticated and can be invoked by anyone. If you have
configured the system to send _"confirm email address"_ emails, the URL transmitted to the user to confirm
his or her email address will resemble the following, except the query parameters will be URL encoded of
course.

```
https://your-frontend-url.com?
token=e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855&
username=john@doe.com&
url=https://your-backend-url.com
```

The above arguments in the URL sent to the user's email address implies the following.

* __[token]__ - A cryptographically secure token that must be supplied to the `verify-email` endpoint as the user confirms his or her email address. Notice, this is _not_ a JWT token but rather a cryptographic hash based upon the user's email address and the auth secret from your _"appsettings.json"_ file. Hence this token can only be used to verify the user's email address, and not to authorise the user in any ways
* __[username]__ - The username of the user that also needs to be submitted to the `verify-email` endpoint as the user confirms his or her email address
* __[url]__ - The root URL for your backend, implying the backend to use as you invoke the `verify-email` endpoint. This might seem a little bit weird until you realise that one backend can have a multitude of frontends, and one frontend can in theory use multiple backends, implying the same frontend client might in theory be able to use multiple different backends. If you only have one backend you can ignore this parameter

This endpoint allows you to create a frontend page somewhere where you accept the above `token` query parameter,
the `username` query parameter, and the `url` query parameter, for then to invoke the `verify-email`
endpoint found below to verify the user's email address, passing in the `token` value found in your query
parameters above as the `token` argument to the `verify-email` endpoint. Notice, Magic's dashboard will
correctly handle these URL arguments if you supply the root-URL/domain to your Magic dashboard as your
`frontendUrl` when invoking the endpoint, but this will of course result in the user being brought onwards
to the Magic dashboard's frontend, which might not be what you wish for in your own apps. The _"register"_
endpoint can return one of the following values if it successfully executes.

* __confirm-email-address-email-sent__ - This implies the user was successfully sent a _"verify email address"_ email
* __already-registered__ - This implies the user has already registered at the site
* __success__ - This implies the user was successfully registered, but no verify email address email was sent

You can override the email template used to send user a _"verify email address"_ email. The default email template
used can be found at `/system/auth/email-templates/register.html`. However, if you create your own email
template you'll have to make sure you _keep_ the dynamically substituted `url` parts in your own custom template.
See how the `href` parameter for the default email template is constructed to understand how this works.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### POST magic/system/auth/verify-email

This endpoint allows a registered user to verify his or her email address, and is typically occurring
after a user has registered and the system has sent the user an email to confirm his or her email address.
The endpoint does not require authorisation, but takes the following payload.

```
{
  "username": "john@doe.com",
  "token": "e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855"
}
```

Notice, the above `token` must be the same token generated by Magic as the user registered, and sent
to the user on his or her email.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### POST magic/system/auth/send-reset-password-link

This endpoint sends a _"reset password email"_ to a registered user. Like the register endpoint, the
endpoint requires a `frontendUrl` field, in addition to of course a username. The
username must be an email address. This endpoint requires that you have configured Magic's SMTP settings
such that it can send an email to the user allowing him or her to reset the password. Below is an
example payload.

```
{
  "username": "john@doe.com",
  "frontendUrl": "https://your-frontend-url.com",
  "template": "/some/path/to-some-email-template.html",
  "subject": "Subject line of change password email"
}
```

The above arguments implies the following.

* __[username]__ - Username/email address for user requesting a new password for
* __[frontendUrl]__ - The URL of the frontend where you want to allow the user to change his or her password
* __[template]__ - The email template used to send the user the _"forgot password"_ email. Optional, and if not specified will default to _"/system/auth/email-templates/reset-password.html"_
* __[subject]__ - Subject line of email to send. Optional, and if not supplied will default to _"Change your password at Aista Magic Cloud"_

The endpoint does not require the caller to be authenticated and can be invoked by anyone, but the endpoint can
only be invoked for a user who's username is a valid email address.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### GET magic/system/auth/verify-ticket

This endpoint allows a frontend to verify an existing JWT token, and it will return _"success"_ if
the JWT token is valid and can be used in consecutive invocations requiring authorisation somehow.
The endpoint can be invoked by any user as long as the user is authenticated. The endpoint does not
take any arguments, but can only be invoked by an already authenticated user, implying you'll need
to pass in your JWT token to it in the Authorization HTTP header as a _"Bearer"_ token. If the JWT
token is not valid the endpoint will return a 401 status code with _"Access denied"_ as its message.
This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

## Plugins endpoints

These are endpoints related to the Bazar somehow, allowing you to install new Bazar modules, and check
which Bazar modules have already been installed. The Bazar is a micro service _"AppStore"_ for your
Magic server, allowing your Magic server to install backend modules on the fly, resulting
in having some backend micro service installed into your backend, without interrupting normal
usage. None of these endpoints are really intended to be consumed by your own code, but only
for internal usage by Magic itself.

### GET magic/system/bazar/app-manifests

This endpoint returns a list of Bazar apps that have been installed in your backend. Each item will
contain a date of installation, the username of the user who installed the app, the name and version
of the app, etc. Most importantly each Bazar manifest item will also contain a _"token"_, which is
typically required as the app is to be updated. Below is an example of what the endpoint might
return if it only has one Bazar item installed. The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user and
it requires no arguments.

```
[
  {
    "name": "Babel Fish",
    "version": "v1.0.0",
    "token": "3b65f514-2e30-4ca2-bdcf-96a2d2727bc1",
    "module_name": "babelfish",
    "installed_by": "root",
    "installed": "2022-01-31T06:03:01.669Z"
  }
]
```

This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/bazar/can-install

This endpoint requires a Magic version number, such as _"v10.0.15"_, and returns either _"SUCCESS"_ or _"ERROR"_,
depending upon whether or not the current version of Magic is above or beneath the specified version number.
It is typically used to verify that a Bazar app can be installed, to verify the Magic version is high enough
for the Bazar item to be successfully installed. The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user. The endpoint
requires the following argument(s).

* __[required_magic_version]__ - Minimum version of Magic requried

This endpoint is considered obsolete and might be removed in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### POST magic/system/bazar/download-from-bazar

This endpoint downloads a Bazar item as a ZIP file from the specified URL, and unzips the file into the backend.
The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user and requires the following payload.

```
{
  "url": "https://some-bazar.com/download?app=some-app.zip",
  "name": "some-module"
}
```

The Bazar item will be downloaded from the specified URL and assumed to be a ZIP file. The ZIP file
will then be unzipped, and unzipped into your _"modules"_ folder as the specified _"name"_. Notice, any
previously installed modules with the same name will be automatically deleted, and the endpoint will _not_
install the module, but only unzip it and create its folder structure. To install the module after it has
been unzipped make sure you invoke the `/system/file-system/install` endpoint.

Notice, this endpoint is considered obsolete and will be changed in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### POST magic/system/bazar/download-from-url

This endpoint downloads a file from its specified __[url]__ and saves it to the specified __[folder]__
in your backend. The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user, and requires the following payload.

```
{
  "folder": "foo",
  "url": "foo"
}
```

The above arguments implies the following.

* __[folder]__ - The folder in your backend you want to save the file
* __[url]__ - The URL to download the file from

The __[url]__ field needs to be a valid URL returning a file, with the `Content-Disposition` HTTP
header correctly applied, since the `Content-Disposition` header's _"filename"_ value becomes
the name of the file on your server.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

## Cache related endpoints

These are the endpoints related to your server side cache, and allows you to query your cache, purge
your cache entirely, or delete a single cache item on the server. Internally Magic is using
server-side cache sparsingly for some expensive operations, such as retrieving meta data from your
database. Sometimes you need to manually purge your cache, and/or delete individual cache items
on your server, to re-retrieve data invalidating your cache in the process. This section provides
information about such operations for such scenarios.

None of these endpoints are really intended to be consumed in your own code, but only
for internal usage by Magic itself.

### GET magic/system/cache/list

This endpoint returns the number of cache items on your server, optionally allowing you to page
with the following query parameters.

* __[limit]__ - Maximum number of items to return
* __[offset]__ - Offset of where to start returning items
* __[filter]__ - Filter key cache items must start with in order to be considered a hit

The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user.

This endpoint is to be considered obsolete and might change in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/cache/count

This endpoint returns the number of cache items in total on your server, optionally starting out
with the _"filter"_ query parameter as their key. The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user.
The endpoint requires the following argument(s).

* __[filter]__ - Optional filter declaring _"namespace"_ of cache items to count

This endpoint is to be considered obsolete and might change in a future version of Magic.

This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### DELETE magic/system/cache/delete

This endpoint requires an **[id]** as a query parameter, and will delete the associated server side
cache item. It can only be invoked by a root user. The endpoint requires the following argument(s).

* __[id]__ - Mandatory id of cache item to evict

This endpoint is to be considered obsolete and might change in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### DELETE magic/system/cache/empty

This endpoint completely empties your server side cache, optionally taking a _"filter"_ query
parameter, which if specified will ensure only cache items _starting_ with the specified filter
key will be deleted. The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user. The endpoint requires the
following argument(s).

* __[filter]__ - Optional filter declaring _"namespace"_ of cache items to evict

This endpoint is to be considered obsolete and might change in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

## Configuration related endpoints

These endpoints are related to configuration of your system, and allows you to read and modify
configuration settings as you see fit. These endpoints are typically not intended for being used
directly by your code, but for the most parts only used during initialisation of your Magic server,
and/or as you change configuration settings in Magic.
None of these endpoints are really intended to be consumed in your own code, but only
for internal usage by Magic itself.

### GET magic/system/config/load

This endpoint loads your configuration settings and returns it to the caller. The endpoint
can only be invoked by a root user and does not require any arguments.

This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### POST magic/system/config/save

This endpoint allows you to save your configuration settings. The specified paylod will
in its entirety overwrite your existing _"appsettings.json"_ file. The endpoint
can only be invoked by a root user. The endpoint can accept any type of JSON payload,
however whatever you supply to the endpoint will in its entirety be persisted in
your backend as your _"appsettings.json"_ file, implying if you supply bogus data,
your backend will no longer function correctly.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/config/status

This endpoint returns the setup status of your system, implying if the system has been correctly
initialised. The endpoint requires no argument. If this endpoint does _not_ return true, the
frontend dashboard will guide you through the process of finishing the configuration process before
allowing you to gain access to other parts of your Magic server. The endpoint can only be invoked
by a root user. This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

## CRUD related endpoints

These endpoints allows you to among other things generate CRUD HTTP backend modules, and is at the heart of
the _"CRUDifier"_ in Magic. In addition these endpoints allows you to generate SQL based HTTP endpoints,
and/or frontends using a template of some sort. These endpoints are not intended for being directly
invoked by your code, but rather from the Magic dashboard as it is creating HTTP backend endpoints for you,
and/or frontends based upon your backend.

## Backend CRUD operations

This section describes the parts that generates backend HTTP endpoints for you, typically wrapping a database
table with CRUD operations.

### POST magic/system/crudifier/crudify

This endpoint creates one CRUD HTTP backend endpoint for you, wrapping the specified database table
with the specified HTTP verb/CRUD-operation. The endpoint requires the following payload.

```
{
  "verbose": true,
  "join": true,
  "databaseType": "xxx",
  "moduleName": "xxx",
  "database": "xxx",
  "table": "xxx",
  "moduleUrl": "xxx",

  "log": "xxx",
  "overwrite": true,
  "validators": "xxx",
  "cache": 42,
  "publicCache": true,
  "cqrs": true,
  "cqrsAuthorisation": "xxx",
  "cqrsAuthorisationValues": "xxx",
  "args": "*",
  "conditions": "*"
}
```

The above fields implies the following.

* __[verbose]__ - If true more query parameter types will be generated for your GET/read endpoint
* __[join]__ - If true, joins will be automatically applied for the endpoint
* __[databaseType]__ - Type of database, such as for instance 'pgsql', 'mssql', or 'mysql'
* __[moduleName]__ - The root URL of your endpoint
* __[database]__ - Name of database, and connection string, e.g. `[generic|sakila]`
* __[table]__ - Name of table to wrap
* __[moduleUrl]__ - Secondary part of your CRUD endpoint's URL
* __[returnId]__ - Only relevant for POST/create endpoints, but if true will return the ID of the newly created item
* __[template]__ - Full relative path of the template to use, e.g. '/system/crudifier/templates/crud.template.get.hl'
* __[verb]__ - HTTP verb to wrap, either 'delete', 'get', 'post' or 'put'
* __[auth]__ - Comma separated list of roles allowed to invoke endpoint
* __[log]__ - Log entry to write upon invocation of endpoint
* __[overwrite]__ - If true will overwrite existing file. If false the invocation will throw an exception if the endpoint file already exists
* __[validators]__ - Hyperlambda code being validators for endpoint
* __[cache]__ - Number of seconds the GET endpoint should be cached (HTTP cache). Only relevant for GET endpoints
* __[publicCache]__ - Whether or not the cache will be public cache, implying possible to cache by proxies. Only relevant if above is non-zero
* __[cqrs]__ - If true will publish SignalR/socket messages upon invocation of endpoint
* __[cqrsAuthorisation]__ - Type of authorisation for SignalR messages published. Legal values are 'inherited', 'roles', 'groups', 'users' or 'none'
* __[cqrsAuthorisationValues]__ - If the above is supplied, these are the comma separated values defining their values. For instance, if you're using _"roles"_ as the above value, this is a comma separated value declaring which roles will be notified when subscribing to the message
* __[args]__ - These are arguments to the endpoint, implying a list of **[columns]** and a list of **[primary]** keys. Primary keys are only relevant for PUT and DELETE endpoints, but columns is a list of objects with _"name"_ and _"type"_ values.
* __[conditions]__ - This is a list of optional query parameters and are only relevant to GET endpoints. If specified it completely overrides the existing query parameters generated automatically by Magic.

The CRUD endpoints to HTTP verb mappings this endpoint generates are as follows.

* __Create__ - HTTP POST verb
* __Read__ - HTTP GET verb
* __Read(count)__ - HTTP GET verb with `-count` postfix in URL
* __Update__ - HTTP PUT verb
* __Delete__ - HTTP DELETE verb

This endpoint can only be invoked by a root user. This endpoint is to be considered obsolete and will probably
change in a future version of Magic.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### POST magic/system/crudifier/custom-sql

This endpoint creates an SQL based HTTP backend endpoint for you. It's similar to the above endpoint, but much simpler
in syntax. It requires the following payload.

```
{
  "databaseType": "xxx",
  "authorization": "xxx",
  "moduleName": "xxx",
  "database": "xxx",
  "arguments": "xxx",
  "verb": "xxx",
  "endpointName": "xxx",
  "sql": "xxx",
  "overwrite": true,
  "isList": true
}
```

The arguments implies the following.

* __[databaseType]__ - Database type your SQL is wrapping. E.g. 'mysql', 'pgsql' or 'mssql'
* __[authorization]__ - Comma separated list of roles allowed to invoke the endpoint
* __[moduleName]__ - Primary URL of endpoint
* __[database]__ - Name of database, and connection string, e.g. `[generic|sakila]`
* __[arguments]__ - Hyperlambda declaratiun of arguments endpoint can handle. E.g. `filter:string`.
* __[verb]__ - HTTP verb endpoint wraps. This can be any of 'get', 'post', 'put', 'delete', and 'patch'
* __[endpointName]__ - Secondary URL for endpoint
* __[sql]__ - Actual SQL executed as endpoint is executing
* __[overwrite]__ - If true invocation will overwrite any existing file, otherwise the invocation will throw an exception if the endpoint file already exists
* __[isList]__ - If true, the endpoint will return an array of objects - Otherwise it will return the first object only.

The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

## Frontend generator

This part describes the frontend generator allowing you to create some sort of frontend, wrapping
your previously created backend endpoints.

### GET magic/system/crudifier/templates

This endpoint returns all frontend templates the system can use for generating frontends. It requires no arguments,
but can only be invoked by a root user. This is used to allow the user to select a frontend template as he or she
wants to generate a frontend of some sort.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/crudifier/template

This endpoint returns Markdown describing the specified template with a humanly understandable description, implying
it returns the README.md file associated with the template specified as the **[name]** query parameter. As the user is
selecting a template, typically displaying the result of invoking this endpoint makes sense, since it allows the user
to understand what the template does for him or her. The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user. The endpoint
requires the following query argument(s).

* __[name]__ - Name of template to return Markdown for

This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/crudifier/template-args

This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### POST magic/system/crudifier/generate-frontend

This endpoint generates a frontend based upon a template, and either puts the result into a local folder on
the server, or returns as a ZIP file download to the client. The endpoint requires the following payload.

```
{
  "templateName": "xxx",
  "apiUrl": "xxx",
  "frontendUrl": "xxx",
  "email": "xxx",
  "name": "xxx",
  "copyright": "xxx",
  "endpoints": "*",

* __[args]__ - Optional argument collection for your template. These are different depending upon which template you use. You can use the _"template-args"_ endpoint to retrieve which arguments, and/or different values each template accepts

The endpoint can only be invoked by a root user.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

## Cryptography related endpoints

These are endpoints related to cryptography somehow, implying among other things the cryptographically secured
HTTP lambda implementation. To understand this feature [read the following article](/tutorials/crypto-lambda-http/)
that describes them from a high level perspective. However, the basic foundation for this feature is to allow
for cryptographically signing a Hyperlambda payload, for then to transmit the payload to another Magic server,
for then to have that Magic server _securely_ execute the specified Hyperlambda, without risking compromising
the server in any ways. In addition this section also describes how to associate a user with a cryptography
key pair, allowing users to sign in with zero username/password requirements, etc.

### PUT magic/system/crypto/associate-user

Associates a specified public cryptography key with a specified user. The endpoints requires the following
payload.

```
{
  "keyId": 42,
  "username": "foo"
}
```

The **[keyId]** is the ID of the public cryptography key, and the **[username]** is the username of the
user you want to associate with the public key. Invoking this endpoint allows the specified user to authenticate
towards the backend using a _"cryptography challenge"_, implying zero username/password, allowing the user
to authenticate using his private cryptography key instead, by giving the client a _"cryptography challenge"_
the client is assumed to be able to cryptographically sign using his or her own private key.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### PUT magic/system/crypto/deassociate-user

The opposite of the above endpoint, allowing a root user to de-associate a user with the specified public
key. Payload to endpoint is as follows.

```
{
  "keyId": 42
}
```

Whatever users are associated with the above public key will be de-associated with their existing key association,
and no longer be able to use cryptography challenges to authenticate towards the backend.
This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code.

### GET magic/system/crypto/challenge

Returns a new cryptography challenge to the client, allowing him to use it to cryptographically sign the
specified challenge, submit the cryptographically signed result to another endpoint, to generate a JWT token
that authorises the client on behalf of the user associated with the public key. The challenge is is valid
for 300 seconds, implying the client needs to be able to cryptographically sign the result, and submit the
cryptographically signed result to the coupled endpoint within 5 minutes to be able to authenticate as the
user associated with his cryptography key. The endpoint can be invoked by anyone, and does not require
any argument(s).

This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### POST magic/system/crypto/challenge

Coupled with the above endpoint, this endpoint allows the user to use his private cryptography key to
authenticate towards the backend without having to supply his or her username/password combination.
After having cryptographically signed the challenge returned from the above endpoint, the user can submit
the signed challenge to this endpoint, resulting in a JWT token being returned, allowing the user to
invoke endpoints afterwards within the context of the user associated with the cryptography key pair.

If the invocation to this endpoint is successful, a valid JWT token will be returned, allowing the
client to use this JWT token to invoke other endpoints authorised as the user associated with the
public cryptography key on the server using the JWT token. The endpoint requires the following
payload.

```
{
  "challenge": "cryptographically-signed-challenge"
}
```

The above argument implies the following.

* __[challenge]__ - Cryptographically signed result from the GET counterpart endpoint in base64 encoded format

This endpoints is intended for you to consume from your own code.

### PATCH magic/system/crypto/eval-id

Executes a cryptographically secured lambda invocation.
See [cryptographically secured lambda invocations](/tutorials/crypto-lambda-http/) to understand what this
implies. The payload is assumed to be binary in the form of `application/octet-stream`, assumed to be
a cryptographically signed Hyperlambda snippet, and only after the signature has been confirmed to belong
to a public key in the database being enabled and allowed to create such HTTP invocations, the Hyperlambda
will be executed within the **[whitelist]** declaration associated with the key the payload was
signed with.

This endpoint is not intended for you to consume in your own code, but rather used indirectly
through the **[magic.crypto.http.eval]** slot.

### POST magic/system/crypto/generate-keypair

will _not_ be enabled, but disabled, and needs to be enabled by an administrator before it can be
used to create cryptographically secured lambda invocations. The payload for the endpoint is as
follows.

```
{
  "subject": "xxx",
  "email": "xxx",
  "domain": "xxx",
  "content": "xxx"
}
