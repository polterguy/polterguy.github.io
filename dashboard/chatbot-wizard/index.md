# Custom ChatGPT website chatbot

The Chatbot Wizard component allows you to rapidly create a ChatGPT website chatbot you can embed on your website.
It's not as powerful as the Machine Learning component, but much easier to use. You can start out with the
Chatbot Wizard, for then to later configure your model with the Machine Learning component.

You'll need an OpenAI API account, and provide Magic with your API key. In addition you'll need a reCAPTCHA account,
and provide your site-key and secret to Magic. Once you've done this, you can just provide your website URL,
click a button, and some few minutes later you've got a custom chatbot you can include on your website.
Once you're done with this process, you can further configure your model using the Machine Learning component,
manually adding training snippets, editing training snippets, etc.
