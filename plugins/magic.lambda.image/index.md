The magic.lambda.image project contains image manipulation functions for Hyperlambda, allowing you to do basic
manipulation of images, in addition to generating QR codes. More specifically this project contains the following slot.

* __[image.generate-qr]__ - Generate a QR code with the specified payload
* __[image.size]__ - Returns the width and height of the specified image
* __[image.resize]__ - Resizes the specified image
* __[image.convert]__ - Converts the specified image to another format
* __[image.crop]__ - Crops the specified image

## Transforming images

All image transformation slots works similarly. They can either be given a string being the relative filename
of the image you want to transform, or a stream from where to load the image. All transformation slots can
also be given a **[type]** argument, which is how to return the image after the transformation is done. Supported
types are as follows.

* png
* jpeg
* bmp
* gif
* tga
* pbm
* tiff
* webp

In addition you can provide a **[dest]** argument, which if specified, becomes the relative path of where to
save the image after transformation has been applied. If not specified, the image will be returned as a stream
to caller, otherwise the image will be saved to the specified file.

### How to use [image.resize]

Resizing an image can be done as follows.

```
image.resize:/some-image.png
   height:250
   type:png
```

The above will resize the specified image to a width of 250 pixel, converting it to PNG, while keeping the
aspect ratio by calculating the new height automatically. You can provide either of.

* __[width]__ - New width
* __[height]__ - New height

You can provide both of the above, but at least one of the above _must_ be specified. If one of the values are
ommitted, it will be calculated by keeping the aspect ratio of the image as is. The **[type]** argument is how
to return the image after the transformation has been applied, and can be any of the supported types as specified
above. Notice, the image might be stretched in one direction if you change the existing width and height ratio
during the transformation.

### How to use [image.crop]

To crop an image you specify the following arguments.

* __[left]__ - Pixels to remove from the left parts of image
* __[top]__ - Pixels to remove from the top parts of image
* __[right]__ - Pixels to remove from the right parts of image
* __[bottom]__ - Pixels to remove from the bottom parts of image

Notice, left + right must be smaller than the total width of the image, and top + bottom must be smaller
than the total height of the image. All arguments are optional, allowing you to only crop an image at one
side, such as for instance illustrated below.

```
image.crop:/modules/test/qr.png
   right:50
```

### How to use [image.convert]

To convert an image from for instance png to jpeg, you can use something such as follows.

```
image.convert:/some-image.png
   type:jpeg
```

The above keeps the image as is, except converts it from its existing format to a jpeg image.

### How to use [image.generate-qr]

You can use the **[image.generate-qr]** slot to create a QR code. This slot returns the QR code as a `MemoryStream`, which
allows you to return its output directly over the HTTP response object, which again will persist the QR code
back as the response to the caller if you're in a web project of some sort using Magic. The slot takes two arguments.

* Value of node - Mandatory string, or an expression leading to a string, which is to become the content of the generated QR code
* __[size]__ - Optional argument declaring the size of your QR code

Below is an example of usage

```
image.generate-qr:"https://docs.aista.com"
   size:8
```

After execution, the above invocation slot will contain a `MemoryStream` encapsulating your underlaying QR code.
Below is an example QR code generated by the library.
